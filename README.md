A smart ML-powered web app that detects whether a news article is real or fake using Natural Language Processing and Streamlit.

NewsSense app is a machine learning–based web application designed to identify fake or misleading news articles.
Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, it allows users to input any news text and instantly receive predictions on whether the article appears real or fake.
The project uses TF-IDF vectorization for text preprocessing and a logistic regression model trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news.

🎯 Features :
🗞️ Input any news article text and get instant results.
🤖 Machine Learning model trained using Logistic Regression .
🧩 TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction.
🌐 Beautiful Streamlit UI for an interactive experience.
💾 Model & vectorizer stored using joblib for quick loading.
📊 Evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score.


## 🧾 Dataset

The model was trained on the [Fake News Classification Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification) by *Saurabh Shahane* from Kaggle.
